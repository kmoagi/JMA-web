<div class="main-content">
  A person’s life journey reflects his purpose in this world. Even the man who sleeps in the street is serving a specific purpose. Everyone is doing his or her bit for the greater universe. The guy who sleeps in the street might be down and out, but he has touched other people’s lives. Those lives he touched, might have been for the greater good or as deterrent. He might live and die, and not be told about it, but his story will be told. It doesn’t matters whether the story is told to the greater audience of the world or to a tiny family, a story will be told.
  That story whether good or bad will have a message and lessons to be learned from it. When it is told, the listeners will absorb it and reflect on it. Then take from it what they want to take from it and leave out what they want to leave out from it. That’s why humans are interconnected. We take and give from each other.
  Mine is the same. But mine in this case, has an objective as to why I am sharing it. I want to take you on this journey from the beginning, though to the darkest moments until the shock moments leading to an awakening, in order for you see how I finally got to where I am.
